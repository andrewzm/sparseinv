Description: Creates a wrapper for the SuiteSparse routines 
    in C that us the Takahashi equations to compute the elements of the 
    inverse of a sparse matrix at locations where the (permuted) Cholesky
    factor is non-zero. The resulting matrix is known as a sparse inverse
    subset. Some helper functions (like the permuted Cholesky factorisation)
    are also implemented. Support for spam matrices is currently limited
    and will be implemented in the future.
